          http
          velocity_x
          geolocator
          and flutter_spinkit
          }
First of all i created splash screen where the class is HelperScreen which has has some frame image with some Text ,image,spinkit
and button 
Button Navigate to HomeScreen where it contain appBar and scaffold, which has some Textfield with suffic icon that has clear property and controller to clear the file
Homescreen button are save and update where it display the location and update it when search
If the location is not entered in Textfield the current location of device will triggered api to get weather
After the api triggered it will show Ui part
If the Location is entered in the TextField it will automatically call api and get weather data that will be displayed in UI,
If location is displayed like Nepal then After changing Nepal in TextField to London and update it .That will be update UI.
